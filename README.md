# evalytics
Data pipeline for `evalytics` data.


## Project structure

The aim is to create a data pipeline that can be used to analyze the data from the evalytics project. The data pipeline is divided into the following components:

1. Read raw data exports and create simple joins. These are joins that require a simple key to join at most two tables.
2. The next step is to create more complex joins. These are joins that require multiple keys to join multiple tables.
3. Finally, we will create datasets on different levels of aggregation. These datasets will be used to create visualizations and to perform statistical analysis.
